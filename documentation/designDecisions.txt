For this project, there were a few decisions I made that I believe were important to produce a great experience for the end user.

1) A high premium on simplicity.

  - This page is simple and direct. There is a navbar greeting, and 4 components with which to act or observe.

2) An active role in guiding focus for the end user

  - Every component is given a gold frame, I did this because I think it draws the user into each decision they can make.

  - Furthermore, inside each decision section (dropdown and filter section) the user is told what they should do.

    There is no getting lost looking for the dropdown options when you are told point blank to navigate to this box.

    Language such as "Select" and "Choose" were intentionally picked so the user didn't have to think.

3) A complete reduction of cognitive overhead.

  - This might be the most underrated thing which I personally seek out when using software!

  - I don't care how goofy it sounds, reducing the dropdown from the normal two clicks to one after a hover
  makes a huge difference.

  - Multiple clicks on multiple screens leads to more work for the user. I believe what they need in a tool
  should be served as lightly as possible.

  - Every action you can take on this page only requires one click!
