**Documentation:**

All documentation and thoughts regarding decisions for this project can be found in the documentation folder.

**Layout/Navigation:**

The structure and order with which these files can be read is intentionally consistent across the html document, css stylesheet, and javascript file.

The project starts at the top with the navbar, then works left to right by going top to bottom on the left side and then the right side of the screen.

For example, after the navbar, the left parent container holds the dropdown at the top, and then the filter section beneath it.

This is consistent when reading code in the stylesheets and the index.js page where components are listed!

After the left parent container, the right parent container begins with the graph at the top and the article section at the bottom.

The only small deviation from this order is near the top of the styles.css file where there is the main-area, followed by the left parent container and the right parent container.
